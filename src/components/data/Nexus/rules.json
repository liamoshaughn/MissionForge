    "title": "Select Secondary Missions",
    "instruction": "Secondary Mission cards detail additional ways to score VP, and must be used either as Fixed or Tactical Missions. Players now secretly note down whether they will use Fixed or Tactical Missions; if using Fixed Missions, they must also note down which two Fixed Missions they will use (see below). Players then reveal these decisions and proceed accordingly.\n\n\nFixed Missions\n\nFixed Missions are goals that remain throughout the battle, and can be achieved multiple times. Your selected Fixed Mission cards cannot be discarded for any reason other than the Adapt or Die Mission Rule card.\n\n\nTactical Missions\n\nTactical Missions are replenished at the start of your Command phase, and are discarded once achieved.\n\n At the start of your first Command phase, draw two cards from your Secondary Mission deck; those two Secondary Mission cards are active for you until you achieve them. At the start of each of your subsequent Command phases, if you have fewer than two active Secondary Mission cards, draw from your Secondary Mission deck until you have two active Secondary Mission cards.\n\nAt the end of your Command phase, you can spend CP to use the New Orders Stratagem\n\nAt the end of either player’s turn, if you scored any VP this turn as described on a Secondary Mission card, discard that Secondary Mission card – it is achieved.\n\nAt the end of your turn, you can discard one or more of your active Secondary Mission cards. If you do, you gain 1CP.\n\nIf your Secondary Mission deck runs out, you cannot generate any additional Secondary Missions during the battle."

Players then reveal these decisions.\n\nReserve Restrictions\n\nNo more than half of the units in your army can start the battle in Reserves, and the points total of those units cannot be more than half of the points total of your army (units embarked within a TRANSPORT that is set up in Reserves also count towards these limits).\n\nReserves units cannot arrive on the battlefield during the first battle round (excluding units placed into Strategic Reserves during the battle).\n\nAny Reserves units that have not arrived on the battlefield by the end of the third battle round count as having been destroyed, as do any units embarked within them (excluding units placed into Strategic Reserves during the battle)."

    "instruction": "At the end of the battle, the player with the most VP is the winner. If the players are tied, the battle is a draw. The maximum VP each player can score is 100VP. Each player scores 10VP if their army is painted to a Battle Ready standard. The maximum VP that can be scored from each source of VP is detailed on below. In all cases, any excess VP awarded above these maximums are lost."
